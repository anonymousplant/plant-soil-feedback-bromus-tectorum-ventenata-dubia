Files and R code associated with manuscript titled: Plant-soil feedbacks may underlie competitive dynamics between co-occurring invasive annual grasses Bromus tectorum and Ventenata dubia

Here we've split the R code into two for this analysis. 
There is one file called "lm_Competition and plant soil feedbacks brte and vedu" and that contains the linear model analysis
The next file called "nls_Competition and plant soil feedbacks brte and vedu" and that contains the non-linear methods
Both files use the .csv "psf.data.24"

You'll notice there's a .xlsx called "psf bootstrap.xlsx"
This is just for visualizations at the end of the nls_ file (these visualizations were not included in the manuscript)
